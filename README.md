# DeepMind Perceiver

*DISCLAIMER: This is not official and I'm not affiliated with DeepMind.*

My implementation of DeepMind's Perceiver. You can read more about the model [on DeepMind's website](https://deepmind.com/research/publications/Perceiver-General-Perception-with-Iterative-Attention).

I trained an MNIST model which you can find in `models/mnist.pkl`. It get's 93.45% which is... so-so. Below are some to-do's that might help out:



## TODO:

- [ ] Positional embedding generalized to *n* dimensions
- [ ] Documentation
- [ ] Type indication
- [ ] Find a better MNIST model
- [ ] Unit tests for components of model
- [ ] Package
